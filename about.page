Mecha already has a built-in function called `test()` to perform simple data inspections returned by PHP expressions.
This extension provides a more useful and complete inspection function by using the global `kint()` function.

### Usage

The way you use it is exactly the same as you would use the `test()` function, so it will be easier for you to refactor
your existing code if you want to use this extension in the long run. It is a good practice to always call this function
within a non-production mode conditional statement, so that this function will not be executed when you are already in
production mode:

~~~ .php
if (defined('TEST') && TEST) {
    if (function_exists('kint')) {
        kint($_COOKIE, $_ENV, $_FILES, $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_SERVER);
    } else {
        test($_COOKIE, $_ENV, $_FILES, $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_SERVER);
    }
    exit;
}
~~~

I really recommend you to install this extension if you want to develop [Panel](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.panel)
features on your own. By using this extension, the Panel data inspection results will look very neat and tidy:

~~~ .php
Hook::set('_', function ($_) {
    kint($_, $_GET, $_POST, $_SESSION, $_SERVER);
    exit;
}, 1000); // Execute as late as possibleâ€¦
