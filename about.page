Mecha already has a built-in function named `test()` to perform simple data inspections returned from PHP expressions.
This extension provides a more useful and complete inspection feature by using the global `kint()` function.

### Usage

The way to use it is exactly the same as how you would use the `test()` function so it will be easier for you to
refactor your existing code if you want to use this extension in the long term. It is a good practice to always call
this function inside a non-production mode conditional statement so that this function will not be executed when you are
already in production mode:

~~~ .php
if (defined('TEST') && TEST) {
    if (function_exists('kint')) {
        kint($_COOKIE, $_ENV, $_FILES, $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_SERVER);
    } else {
        test($_COOKIE, $_ENV, $_FILES, $_GET, $_POST, $_REQUEST, $_SERVER);
    }
    exit;
}
~~~

I really recommend you to install this extension if you want to develop [Panel](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.panel)
features. By using this extension, the Panel data inspection results will look very neat and concise:

~~~ .php
Hook::set('_', function ($_) {
    kint($_, $_GET, $_POST, $_SESSION, $_SERVER);
    exit;
}, 1000);
